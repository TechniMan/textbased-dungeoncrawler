# TextBased-DungeonCrawler
## A text-based dungeon crawler written with straight-forward C++

[![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/TechniMan/textbased-dungeoncrawler)](https://repl.it/github/TechniMan/textbased-dungeoncrawler)

It has a dumb name because I am bad at names.

Basically one evening I got home from work with a cool idea for a very simple game I could make with RPG mechanics, that wouldn't be too difficult to build and shouldn't take too much time to put together. Here it is! After getting the minimal parts done, I've decided to keep adding to it until I get bored or run out of ideas.

## Description

Coming soon.

## License

GNU GPL v3. I feel like this is a simple little project that would be more useful being kept open for learning etc.

## Dependencies

* Requires: cmake, make, g++ to build.
* Uses [nlohmann/json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) (MIT) and [pcg-random](http://www.pcg-random.org/) (Apache 2.0), both included in the `include` directory.

## Plan

Coming soon.

## How To Build

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/techniman/textbased-dungeoncrawler.git
$ cd textbased-dungeoncrawler
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
$ ./textbased_dungeoncrawler
